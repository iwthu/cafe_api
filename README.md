# cafe_api

This project is a REST API built with Flask that provides information about cafes in a given area. The API allows users to search for cafes by location and retrieve details such as coffee prices, seating capacity, and available amenities like WiFi, toilets, and power sockets. The data is stored in a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy for easy management and retrieval.
